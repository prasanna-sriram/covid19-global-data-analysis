## Overview

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data using SQL to identify trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can support public health decision-making and policy formulation across different regions.

## Problem Statement

The COVID-19 pandemic generated massive amounts of data, but understanding global patterns in deaths and vaccination rates was complex. This project aims to simplify that by querying, cleaning, and analyzing structured data to answer key questions about how the virus impacted different countries.

## Data

- **Source**: [Public COVID-19 dataset - Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)
- **Description**:
  - Key columns: `country`, `date`, `total_cases`, `total_deaths`, `population`, `new_vaccinations`, `total_vaccinations`, `continent`
  - No target variable; analysis-focused
  - Dataset size: ~500,000+ records covering multiple countries and dates

## Approach

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**:
   - Standardized column names and data types
   - Removed nulls and inconsistent entries
   - Handled date and numerical formatting issues
2. **Data Analysis in SQL**:
   - Used `JOINs`, `CTEs`, `WINDOW` functions for temporal and group analysis
   - Calculated death rates, vaccination rates per population
   - Identified top and bottom countries by various health indicators
3. **Insight Generation**:
   - Analyzed death rates by country to quantify the mortality risk of COVID-19 globally.
   - Identified countries where a large portion of the population contracted COVID, with infection rates exceeding 20% in the hardest-hit regions.
   - Summarized total deaths by continent to highlight regional impact, with clear disparities between continents.
   - Conducted a time-series analysis to track global case and death progression, revealing spikes and changes in death percentages over time.
   - Examined vaccination rollout over time by country, calculating percentage of population vaccinated to compare progress across nations.

## Project Outcome

- **Death Rate Analysis**: Found significant differences in country-level death rates â€” some with mortality rates exceeding 5% relative to total cases, emphasizing disparities in healthcare infrastructure.
- **Infection Spread**: Identified that certain countries saw over 25% of their population infected, while others remained under 5%, indicating uneven pandemic control.
- **Continental Mortality Comparison**: Ranked continents by total death counts, with clear geographic trends showing higher impacts in specific regions.
- **Temporal Trends**: Tracked how global cases and deaths evolved over time, revealing peaks in infection followed by sharp rises in death percentages.
- **Vaccination Progress**: Used rolling totals to assess vaccination over time and computed the percentage of population vaccinated, highlighting early vs. late adopters.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prasanna-sriram/covid19-global-data-analysis.git
   ```

2. Go to the project directory

    ```bash
    cd covid19-global-data-analysis
    ```

3. Open CovidProjectQueries.sql in SQL Server Management Studio

4. Run the queries on the cleaned data provided under [COVID Deaths](data/clean_data/CovidDeaths.xlsx) and [Covid Vaccinations](data/clean_data/CovidVaccinations.xlsx)

## Conclusion

This SQL-based analysis provided a clear picture of how COVID-19 affected countries and continents differently, both in terms of mortality and vaccination coverage. It showcased the value of structured query analysis in transforming raw health data into interpretable metrics for policymakers and analysts. Future work could include integrating this SQL logic into a Power BI dashboard for interactive, real-time insights and public communication.
